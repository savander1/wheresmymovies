- sqlce db of movies and their locations

- which book are they in? itunes? movies folder? converted? need to be?

- simple crud db using azure and pw protected to let me know where my movies are.

- We should try to push as much processing onto the client as possible and load the movie locations out of browser storage if possible.

- future release will have an ios app to locate movies.
